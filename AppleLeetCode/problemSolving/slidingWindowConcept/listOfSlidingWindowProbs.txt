Fixed Window & Vairable Window sizes

Problems under Fixed Window sizes
1. Max/Min Sub array of size k - find sub array of fixed size which gives max or min sum - Done
2. First negative in every window size of k - Done
3. Count occurrence of anagram - done
4. Max of all sub array of size k - done
5. Max of min of every window size - done
General Format of Fixed size Window

while(j < size) {
    calculations
    if(windowSize < k) { //if(j-i+1 < k)
        j++;
    }
    else if(windowSize === k) {
        ans from above calculations
        calculations remove i
        window size maintain
            and slide
    }
}
return ans

Problems under Variable Window size
1. Largest/Smallest sub array of sum k - find largest sub array in size which adds to give the sum k
2. Largest sub string of k distict characters
3. Length of largest substring with no repeating characters
4. Mininum window substring - Important

General Format of Variable size Window

while(j < size) {
    calculations
    if(condition > k) { //k being window size and condition being Sum for example
        while(condition > k) {
            remove calculation for i
            i++
        }
    } else if(condition === k) {
        get answer from above calculation
    }
    j++ //Increment j in all conditions including the condition < k
}
