Recursion Problems

1. I/p - O/p method
2. Extended I/p - O/p method

1. I/p - O/p method
a to e -> uses IBH method -> Induction, base condition, hypothesis
f to h -> uses Recursion Tree -> I/p O/p method

a. Print 1 to n / n to 1
b. Sort an array
c. Delete middle element in a stack
d. Remove duplicates from string
e. count the number of occurences
f. subset
g. Permutations with space(variations) - with case change and many more
h. Joseplus problem

2. Extended I/p - O/p method

a. Binary string with # of 1's greater than # of 0's
b. Generate balanced paranthesis


4 Approaches to Recursion
--------------------------
1. Recursion Tree -> I/p O/p method
2. Base condition - Induction - Hypothesis <- Making I/p smaller (IBH method)
3. Choice Diagram (used in Dynamic Programming)
